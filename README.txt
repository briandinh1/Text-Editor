Basic text editor with GUI interface. I made it look like Notepad and Python's IDLE GUI editor as much as possible.
Supports the most basic functions of a text editor such as copy, cut, paste, select all, undo. It can save and open files, but only .txt format

Small features were also copied, such as changing the title bar to reflect the current document path, asking to save a new file when saving for the first time, automatically stretch to fit the size of the screen / window
