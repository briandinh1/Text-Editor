Basic text editor with GUI interface. EXE file ready for demo

I made it look like Notepad and Python's IDLE GUI editor as much as possible.
Editor is able to cut, copy paste, select all, undo. File browser to open and save files
It can only work with .txt format

Other features include: 
Keyboard shortcuts for all major functions
Change title bar to reflect the current document path
Asking to save a new file when saving for the first time
Automatically stretch to fit the size of the screen / window
