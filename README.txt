Basic text editor with GUI interface. EXE file ready for demo

I made it look like Notepad and Python's IDLE GUI editor as much as possible.
Supports the most basic functions of a text editor such as copy, cut, paste, select all, undo. It can only work with .txt format

Other feature:
Change title bar to reflect the current document path
Asking to save a new file when saving for the first time
Automatically stretch to fit the size of the screen / window
